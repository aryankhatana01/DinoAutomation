Can be played online at:-  chrome://dino/

Notes:-

1) This would only work with light theme in Google chrome because with the dark theme the cactuses are white and background is black.
2) Focus the window with the game in 3 seconds.
3) This wont work always...sometimes you can get a 'Game over'
4) Try tweaking the values of the rectangle coordinate for perfection.
